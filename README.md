This extension was created because I wanted a more logical way to uninstall portable applications like Flatpaks and Appimages.
I used Google Gemini to generate the extension so there is probably a more efficiant way to make this code work, but it works nonetheless.

It was tested on Flatpaks that are Electon and non-Electron based. It also asumes that Appimages are stored in ~/.appimage.

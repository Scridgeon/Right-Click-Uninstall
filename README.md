This extension offers a streamlined way to uninstall Flatpaks and AppImages through right-clicking on the app icon.
The code was built using Google Gemini and could likely be further refined but works as intended.
Please note that it has been verified for Electron and non-Electron Flatpaks, and it expects AppImages to be located in the ~/.appimage directory.
